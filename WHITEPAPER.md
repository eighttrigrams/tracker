# Tracker

A personal task tracker with context-based grouping.

## Concept

Tasks can be tagged with **people** and **places**. This enables efficiency through contextual batching:

- **People**: When meeting someone, filter to see all tasks related to that person
- **Places**: When visiting a location, see what else can be done while there

This is a single-user system. People and places are not users - they are context tags for grouping your own tasks.
