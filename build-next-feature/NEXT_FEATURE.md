For the Mail page,
for the messages, I want to, when we click on a Message sender, the messages to be filtered to only show
messages for that sender. We don't need a 2-column layout here. We just present, in the form of the "Exclude" filter badges
from the Today page, present a single item above the list, which represents the sender we filter FOR. it should get an "x" such
that we can show all messages again.
