On the Today page, in contrast to the Tasks page,
we can't edit the title or the description of tasks.

Fix that.

But one thing to note here, on the Today page, in contrast to the tasks page, we don't show the additional tags field.
Make sure to not null or empty it when it contains something. Simply don't show it on the Today page's tasks cards edit sections.

Also, we can change context and importance, but not urgency.

Fix that.
