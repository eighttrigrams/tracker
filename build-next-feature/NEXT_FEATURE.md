This is a bug. 

Repro: I go to the Tasks page.

I click sort order "Done".

It shows me all the done tasks.
Now I switch to Today page.

It shows me, albeit filtered and sorted into categories like "Overdue" Done tasks!
On the Today page, that should never be the case. There we want to show only still open tasks.
