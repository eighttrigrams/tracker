in the last iteration, we added the capacity to edit time of tasks on the Today
page

However, I have gripes with the impl.

First of all, I said only those tasks which already have a time, are able to change
their time on the Today page. (the Tasks page is left as is)

And then, the position of the clock symbol should go after the task name/title,
just like on the cards on the Tasks page.

Here, it suddenly was before the title. I didn't ask for that!


Again, I am speaking only about the little clock symbol, only that time edit clock symbol when uncollapsed goes after the title,
the written in digits time and date do not get touched.
