When we visit the Tasks page, 
and while we leave a task was "open" (i.e. in uncollapsed state),
going to another page/view/tab, and return back,
we find all tasks are collapsed.

Formulated differently, whenever we visit the 
Tasks page (or the Today page, for that matter),
we find all task cards collapsed.

The same should hold for the Messags tab/view.
When we happen to leave it with a task open,
and come back later to it, we should find it 
with all tasks collapsed (no "open").
