Recently we've build a feature that when a task card is opened, an we hover over the section (which is really a row, where also the Mark task done button is placed)
it is shown visible. I like everything about that, but feel
that a minor transition into visibility of lets say 0.75s or so should happen, otherwise its so aprupt and out of touch with other transitions
we do in the app.

And then - minor complaint - in dark mode the color scheme is not in accordance with how its done in light mode. it should be simply inverted, 
I believe the confusion there comes from the task card being light, instead dark. It should really be dark, dark task card background on dark background overall,
just like in light mode both the background and the task card background are kind of light. Don't touch the color scheme of the light mode at all, only fix the dark 
mode one. Also in the category pickers, the small ones in the tasks cars themselves, should also be dark, and their dropdowns as well, backgroudn,
otherwise one does not see the white script in the dropdowns
