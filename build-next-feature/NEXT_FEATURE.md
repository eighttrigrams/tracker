Allow two things now for the Mail tab.

First of all, add an input field, which lets us add messages on our own.
The sender gets registered as "Daniel de Oliveira"

And then, let us allow to have a reverse sort order between Recent and Archived, which
shows us open messages, but in reverse order, oldest first.
