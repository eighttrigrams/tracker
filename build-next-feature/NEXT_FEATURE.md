# Next Feature

We want a dark mode switch. It should sit next between the private/work mode toggle and the login
group and feature a moon/sun.

On pressing it, the colors should transition during 2 seconds.
The button height is same as the private work toggle.

We don't need to persist the mode across reloads.
