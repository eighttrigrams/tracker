next thing we build is that tasks can be marked default (well they are not really marked then), urgent, or superurgent.
this really all works like the stars system which mark them as important and critical.

however, we wont have any extra sort filter in the Tasks page. mind you, we will only be able to set the urgency setting
in the tasks cards inside the Tasks page, not elsewhere. but using we do the urgency setting in the following way

# usage

we use it on the Today page, by squeezing in a "Urgent Matters" between the today section and the upcoming tasks section,
if and only if there are urgent items. when there are urgent items, the section is shown, and the tasks are ordered:

topmost superurgent items, below urgent items, both in the same section.
then inside the subsections (not market as those but distinguished by the grouping), we rank those with the higher sort order 
first (as per manual sort order)
