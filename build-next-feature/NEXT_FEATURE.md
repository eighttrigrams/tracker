On the Mail page, I can filter messages by clicking on the Sender,
this then gets sent to the top and displayed as a green badge.

Now, I want to add *negative* filtering to the mix. It works as follows:
When no positive filter is active, I am able to click on a sender with holding the shift key,
and then it should filter *out* messages from that sender. I can add any number of senders to that
list, they get shown as red badges at the top.

Again, for positive filtering, only one is allowed. For negative filtering as many as I want.
