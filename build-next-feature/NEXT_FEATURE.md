On the Today page, in the Urgent Matters section,
I want to see two subsections, the upper one is headed by two car siren emojys, the lower one by one car siren emojy.

In the sections, of course, in the upper are the superurgent tasks, in the lower one the urgent tasks.
No matter if there are tasks or not for any of those categories, we both show them at all times,
to play nicely with the following.

Tasks in this view and sesction should be reorderable via drag and drop. Search the app for how we accomplished 
that elsewhere, see if we can imitate existing patterns and optimally re-use functions.
We can rearrange items within the sections, but you can also drag them between sections, for example drag 
an urgent task into the superurgent sections, upon wich, you guessed it, the tasks urgency status gets updated
in a persistent manner.
