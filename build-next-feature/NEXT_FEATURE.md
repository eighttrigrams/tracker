bug report.

all categories i selected in the Tasks view, apply only to the Tasks view.
That is, when I select a place from the Tasks view, and visit the Today
page, it does not matter what categories (here a place) I selected *on the Tasks page*

When going to the Today page, it should look up in the state corresponding to the Today page
which categories are selected **there**. So the two pages have separated states.

Maybe we should follow the pattern we have set a precenent for with the Mail page, namely
that each page gets its own state atom.
