In the Mail view, I want, in each message card, to be seen only as long as a message is in collapsed state,
a big white (the inner is white, in light mode) checkbox, which is also only seen in Reverse and Recent, but not in Archived sort order.

What is does? The obvious thing of marking it as "archived".

How? With a transition. When I click the checkbox, a blue checkmark appears in it, and then it takes a while, a second or so, for
the whole card to disappear itself, slowly fade away or somethign.  Maybe also the checkmark should fade in over 0.3s or whatever looks good.
It should all have a bit of a "haptic feel".
