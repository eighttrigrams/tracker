Recently, we implemented relations between resources, meetings, and tasks items. 

I now want, when one clicks on one of these relations badges, the corresponding item to go open in a modal. 
Until now, we entered modals through the pencil button for editing, so we landed on the edit tab. We always had the option of going into the preview tab, which is the first tab in the modal. 
Now that the situation is a little bit different, we want to actually enter in the "normal" tab in the first tab. But still we want to be able to make 
changes and save should we decide, so in the edit tab So we have the option of editing and then leaving the modal through save or through the cancel button. 

We just stay in the same view or page the whole time. If we open any relation by clicking on a relation batch on the tasks page, we stay on the tasks page; we just overlay the tasks page with the modal.
