there is this inconsistency regarding the urgency picker.

on the Today page, the urgent matters section has these nice alarm sirens to represent urgent and superurgent

on the task cards then on the other hand, when they are uncollapsed, they have this
row on the bottom with the urgency and importance pickers, and there the urgency is simbolized by exclamatino marks;
this, I don't like so much.

Since this is a fairly small task, as a sidequest, go through core.cljs; there are a couple of code blocks
which are virtually identical in structure, so would lend themselves to get extracted into functions. See what you can do there.
