When on the Tasks page, up until now we are allowed to click a single category
filter badge, on a task card, if and only if no category filter is selected yet.

We want to improve the situation as follows:

Whenever no category filter at all is activated, we are allowed to activate any
category filter by clicking a badge on a task.

Now, after that, we are allowed to add category filter by click, only if they are of a different
category TYPE.

I.e. when I click the badge for a certain place, lets say Lagos, then I can go to the LHS
and add other place filters, but I cannot do that by clicking on category badges on tasks.

However, I am allowed to add a category filter by clicking on a badge if that badge is of a different type.
For example, after I selected a place, I may click on any other project type category badge.

For each category type, only one selection can be made that way. The little pointer cursor should reflect that
for a cateory type which I "can send" to the LHS, the pointer is there, if a category selection is "exhausted"
the hand pointer is not available on hover over a corresponding badge.
