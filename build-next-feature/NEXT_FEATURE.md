In the Tasks page, and in the Today page in the Urgent Matters section,
make sure to never provide / allow reordering of tasks per drag and drop
whenever a task is uncollapsed/not collapsed, for the user is editing
it or wanting to look closely at it. These two features conflict,
so, when a user wants to use drag and drop again, they must collapse
the task first.

Make sure you understand me right: whenever any task on a page is uncollapsed
Drag & Drop for reordering is in generall OFF, until that task is collapsed
again and no task is open/uncollapsed.
