There is a bug. When you visit the Tasks page,

adding, removing, or marking tasks done, while
an active category filter is activated (see left hand sidebar)
for filtering to see only corresponding tasks,
all of a sudden leads to me seeing all tasks, not only 
those filtered, immediately after an action performed.

This is clearly a big problem.
