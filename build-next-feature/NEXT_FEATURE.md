On the messages / mail feature, it would be important to display not
only the dates, but also the time when the messsage came.

And because this is such a small feature, we will use the oportunity to do another cleanup round (to not waste cycles and tokens).

I want you to break long files down into smaller files with clear responsibilities.
I believe all longer files have the problems that different things, dealing with different **responsbilities** are crammed into a single namespace or
css file or whatever.

Go through the whole codebase and find things to clean up.

But don't do everything at once. Rather focus on the biggest blunders and violations of above stated principle.
