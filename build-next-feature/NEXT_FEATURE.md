On the Today page, I don't wwant to see Upcoming tasks and Urgent Matters at the same time.

I want to see the Overdue tasks first (if any, if not, box is hidden. no change).
Then the Today section (always shown, even if empty; no change)

Now, there should be a right aligned tab switcher (like the one on the Tasks page for sort order choice),
by which we be able to switch between Urgent Matters and Upcoming tasks.

It has not to be persisted between page refreshes/reloads of the whole app which one we see, but
when we switch tabs in the main navigation, say, between Tasks and Today, after coming back
the same subpage should still be shown.
