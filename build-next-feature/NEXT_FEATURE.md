On the Tasks page,
when we choose Done sort order,
for some reason there is not search bar available.
I think I know why. It is because the search bar usually doubles
as a task creation bar. 

Make it so that in the Done sort order, the search bar is shown,
but the ability to create tasks is not available. Neither is
the button available, nor can we press option+enter like under the other
search orders. Also, the placeholder text might need adjustment under that sort order.
