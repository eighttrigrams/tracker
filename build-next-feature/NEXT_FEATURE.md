# Next Feature

We want to be able to tag tasks with an importance property.

All tasks by default are of default/normal importance.
The next level is important.
The next level is critical.

Effects of this in the UI are that on the Tasks tab/view, to the left
next to sort order, disconnected from the sort order group, there is a three
way switch, which is off by default, but when set to

- 1 (important; symbol is 1 star or whatever) - one sees no default importance tasks anymore
- 2 (critical) - one sees only critical tasks any longer

So this is an additional filter which applies to that page.

Note that as an additional requirement, when all category selector groups on the left
hand side are collapsed, and the cursor is not in one of their input fields, but rather
outside, anywhere on the tasks page, be it search tasks or add tasks or whereever outside
and we press option+escape, the importance filter gets cleared, in addition to the category filters.
