On the Tasks page, the Add new tasks widget should simply be integrated into the "search" bar (which will now become a combined multi-purpose input).
The search input and the Add button will share a row now, and share the full width of a row (as much horizontal space as a task takes).

When I enter something in the search field, it filters, as usual. When I click the Add button, it creates a task with that name.
When I am with my cursor in the search/create input, and press enter, nothing happens. but when I press option+enter, a new task
with that name should get created.
