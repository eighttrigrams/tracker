This will be a code cleanup round.

I want you to break long files down into smaller files with clear responsibilities.
I believe all longer files have the problems that different things, dealing with different **responsbilities** are crammed into a single namespace or
css file or whatever.

Go through the whole codebase and find things to clean up.

But don't do everything at once. Rather focus on the biggest blunders and violations of above stated principle.
