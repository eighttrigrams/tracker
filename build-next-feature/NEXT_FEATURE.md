There are still quite some cases where we just "bash strings" together to form SQL
queries instead of using HoneySQL. 

Improve that situation, but keep the change size controlled. You don't need to do everything in one go.
Find a good set of coherent changed which make sense to work through together in one go.

I might do another pass tomorrow.
