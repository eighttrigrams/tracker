The Urgent Matters / Upcoming switcher just implemented looks good. Almost.

The switcher buttons group itself looks ugly. First of all, it is not right-aligned as I wanted it to be.

Secondly, we should not have different styling for similar elements across the app. On that Tasks page,
there is a sort order switcher, which lets one choose between Manual, Recent, Due Date and Done. It is this
styling which I envision for our sub-page switcher here as well.
