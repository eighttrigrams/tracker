In the task cards, i can always say either set task done or set task undone (left hand side, in light mode blue colored button) and 
then on the other side (right side) a delete button. 

I now want to have one button. Right aligned, which is normally for marking a card done / undone. On that button, on the right side
should be a small dropdown chevron, that when pressed opens a 1 item dropdown, which has the delete option on it then.
