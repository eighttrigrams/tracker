Okay. In the mail tab, where the messages are, I want the following: Whenever a message contains, as part of its title or name, a URL, one or more URLs, then the first of these URLs should be subject to the following, which I'm gonna explain now. 

So when I uncollapse the message, there is an archive button on the left-hand side. Whenever the title contains a URL, then the archive button should get this chevron, which, when pressed, opens up another drop-down. We have the same situation with tasks, where we could either delete them or mark them as done. It should be the same UI anyway, but here it's like the archive button on the left-hand side. How it should get this chevron and drop-down, and the first item, or only item, of this drop-down is "Convert to resource". 

So now how does that work? When I press that button, then it will delete this note as a note and this message as a message. It won't archive it; instead, it will recreate that message as a resource with context scope BOSE. The extracted URL should be the URL of the resource. The original title of the message should become the title of the resource, and the original description and a possible comment. You know that with messages we can also leave comments like these. Both combined, the description and the comment will become the total description of the resource.
