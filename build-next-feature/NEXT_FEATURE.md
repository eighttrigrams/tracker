When on tasks page, and we "visit" one of the category selector sections in the left hand sidebar, uncollapse it and our cursor
is in its input field, and then press *escape*, or *option+escape*, in addition to the "normal" action which should happen then (
in the one case collapsing the group, in the other deselecting the selected categories for the group and collapsing then),
it should now also position the cursor back in the input/search field.
