I recently overhauled the color scheme of the left hand side category pickers
on the TAsks page, where we would assign a unique color to each of the four groups,
which is in accordance to the badges which are shown underneath accordingly categorised tasks.

Not, on the Today page, this is confusing that the color scheme is totall different.
I want you to fix that this matches the color scheme from the Tasks page:

1. The Places category should have the same color coding as on the tasks page
2. The Projects category should have the same color coding as on the tasks page

When I select categories, they are when unselected, not colored, just like on the tasks page the behaviour.
Once I select them, they get that color, only that the text is now striked through (only visible difference)
