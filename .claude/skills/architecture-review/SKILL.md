## Focus Areas

- Separation of concerns
- Dependency direction and coupling
- Consistency with existing patterns
- Scalability implications
- Testability of the design
- Potential for code reuse
- Layer violations

## Process

1. Identify the boundaries and layers in the code
2. Trace dependencies between modules
3. Check for violations of established patterns
4. Assess impact on existing architecture
