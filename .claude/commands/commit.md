If you have tested the changes, you can commit them now to the current git branch, whichever that is.

Try to remember what was the last thing I worked on and create commits with the relevant artefacts, leaving
files unstaged which don't belong to a commit. Let the user rather ask for another commit.

From there, go backwards. If there is another coherent set left after the first commit, find the next set, which
is what I worked on before that. You might remember what that was.

If there are commits which are simple edits to config file templates or scripts or such things which I myself did,
just commit them, finding an appropriate name.
